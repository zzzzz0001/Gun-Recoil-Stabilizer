# Gun-Recoil-Stabilizer
This is an extraction from https://github.com/ebellocchia/auto_mouse_mover

You need a dataset to run this software. Example of CSV dataset has been put in CSV Dataset folder.
First line could be a header (its upto you if you want to use the header or not)
The number of lines for dataset could be unlimited
Each row of csv shows each target relative pixels to move.

A vertical stabilizer can only stabilize y-axis movement whereas spray stabilizer can deal with x-axis too.
Spray pattern works well with a gun which got a paattern based recoil.

NOTE : RUN IT WITH ADMIN RIGHTS TO MAKE SURE IT WOULD WORK.
