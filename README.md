# Gun-Recoil-Stabilizer
This is an extraction from https://github.com/ebellocchia/auto_mouse_mover

You need a dataset to run this software. Example of Json file has been put in **Json Dataset** folder.

You can add more datapoints if you like in the dataset.

A vertical stabilizer can only stabilize y-axis movement whereas spray stabilizer can deal with x-axis too.
Spray pattern works well with a gun which got a paattern based recoil.

NOTE : RUN IT WITH ADMIN RIGHTS TO MAKE SURE IT WOULD WORK.
